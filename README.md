# Note Taker

## Description

In my note taker web application a user is able to enter thier notes into the text box with a Title and Text below. When the user inputs their note they can save it by clicking the save icon in the upper right hand corner of the webpage. After clicking the save icon the users note will present on the left hand side of the browser. Next to their not will be a delete icon where they can delet thier note. To start a new note the user can either simply write a new not in the title and text text box or click the new note icon in the upper right hand corner (next to the save icon) of the browser to start a new note.
